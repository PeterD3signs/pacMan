# pacMan
A minigame inspired by Pac Man done fully with Java and Java Swing

This project was created in 2023 and contains all /src files in the exact form they were coded during that time.
It also won't be changes in the future. I decided to keep this repo unchanges to beter show my code progression.

The project was done as part of a GUI (Graphical User Interface) Java Course during my University studies. I recieved the highest mark possible for this project.

DESCRIPTION:
This game is just like regular Pac Man, but with added custom power-ups.
It is based on an AbstractTableModel and a JTable (required format).

Apart from the game itself, there is also a start up menu, high scores menu, and an error log (available with a Ctrl + Shift + E shortcut).

Available power-ups are:
- eating the ghosts
- 3x acceleration
- freezing the movement of ghosts
- 10s of immortality
Power ups are dropped randomly by ghosts.
