# pacMan
A minigame inspired by Pac Man done fully with Java and Java Swing

This project was created in 2023 and contains all /src files in the exact form they were coded during that time.
It also won't be changed in the future. I decided to keep this repo original to better show my code progression.

The project was done as part of a GUI (Graphical User Interface) Java Course during my University studies. I received the highest mark possible for this project.

DESCRIPTION:
This game is just like regular Pac Man, but with added custom power-ups.
It is based on an AbstractTableModel and a JTable (required format).
It relies heavily on multithreading, as this was the main practice element for this project.
Each window in the app is dynamically scaleable, and each graphic (/src/resources) is custom made.

Apart from the game itself, there is also a start up menu, high scores menu, and an error log (available with a Ctrl + Shift + E shortcut).

Available power-ups are:
- eating the ghosts
- 3x acceleration
- freezing the movement of ghosts
- 10s of immortality
Power ups are dropped randomly by ghosts.

High scores are saved in a .txt file and read automatically on game start.
No Window Builders were used during coding.

What would I change if I were to make this project again:
- Much like with my other projects from that time, I am very happy with the content itself. One thing I would improve on though is code readability and better file organization.
